# Using Swagger in Liberty [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.swagger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.swagger)

This sample contains a few ways of how to use Swagger documentation within Liberty. This application contains
two individual servlets:  the JAX-RS servlet is used to handle requests to a Tasks API, which allows user to create, view and delete Task objects, while the second servlet is an extension of a HTTPServlet and is used to resond to requests for a Contacts API.
Contacts API lets you create, view and update Contact objects.

[TasksResource](/swagger-sample/src/main/java/net/wasdev/swaggersample/jaxrs/TasksResource.java) is a
JAX-RS resouce classs that uses both JAX-RS and Swagger annotations to document the API.

Documentation for HTTPServlet based API [ContactsServlet](/swagger-sample/src/main/java/net/wasdev/swaggersample/servlet/ContactsServlet.java)
is provided using Swagger stub file [swagger.json](/swagger-sample/src/main/webapp/META-INF/stub/swagger.json)

## Getting Started

Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself:
* [Building and running on the command line](/docs/Using-cmd-line.md)
* [Building and running using Eclipse and WebSphere Development Tools (WDT)](/docs/Using-WDT.md)

Once the server has been started, go to [REST API Discovery](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2016/02/17/exposing-liberty-rest-apis-swagger/) Explorer at [https://localhost:9444/ibm/api/explorer/](https://localhost:9444/ibm/api/explorer/)
to interact with the sample. Default credentials are login: user, password: demo
